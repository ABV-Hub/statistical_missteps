Here we show, through Monte Carlo experiments, three examples of statistical missteps that we have seen in the reservoir characterization literature.

The mistakes are
1. Applying algebra to linear least squares regression models
2. Improperly de-transforming a log-transformed variable in a linear least square model without accounting for bias
3. Mis-applying R^2^

The examples are in Statistics pitfalls.ipynb. Anyone can run these examples on Binder or Google Colab by clicking on the buttons above.
